## My Role
I took on the responsibility of guiding the team through the process. I contributed by assisting in primary and secondary research, leading the interviews and analysis through product management frameworks, and designing and collaborating on Figma prototypes.

## The Problem Statement
In an era dominated by e-commerce and quick-commerce platforms, traditional retail markets in India face challenges like operational inefficiencies and limited consumer reach. HastyBuzz, a visionary initiative, seeks to address these hurdles by offering small retailers the tools and support they need to thrive in a digital economy. Here's a closer look at how HastyBuzz aims to revolutionize the landscape of traditional retail.

Traditional retailers, particularly kirana stores, pharmacies, and local outlets, struggle with:

- Inefficient supply chains that hinder cost savings.
- Lack of digital presence, limiting their market reach.
- Difficulty in competing with attractive deals offered by large e-commerce platforms.
## Product Vision
Transforming traditional market system by adding up a digital dimension and bridgingthe information gap between the retailers & Manufacturers to make them more profitable.
## The Market for the product
HastyBuzz’s offerings are designed to address the core needs of its users:

- Retailers: Enhanced visibility, streamlined inventory management, and access to new consumers.
- Manufacturers: Direct promotional opportunities and better distribution channels.
- Customers: Improved shopping experiences and access to diverse products.
 
## Value proposition

The platform alleviates pains like complex supply chains, poor transparency, and limited consumer reach by digitizing inventory management, streamlining procurement, and offering direct access to manufacturers. It creates gains such as cost savings, enhanced visibility, and simplified ordering processes, empowering retailers with real-time updates, integrated communication tools, and a centralized online marketplace. With these offerings, HastyBuzz bridges the gap between small retailers and the digital economy, enabling them to thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.

2. Adding an option for “Shared with My Devices”

In the Quick Share settings UI, there are several options related to Accounts, Nearby Sharing, Sharing with Contacts, and Private Sharing. However, none of these subsections include an option for "Shared with My Devices," which would allow users to view the history of files shared with their personal devices. The History feature, which would typically enable users to view shared files directly without creating a link, is also absent in Quick Share. Furthermore, there is no way to view files that have been shared specifically with "my devices" (personal devices).

The process becomes cumbersome if the user has to view what files he  she shared within their own devices.


To navigate through this issue, the following was proposed:

An additional section is added titled “Shared with my devices” allowing the user to view the shared files between their own devices easily. Additional options to search and sort the files by date can also be provided to the user.

### Final Thoughts

This project was my first hands-on experience in the industry, and it was both exciting and challenging. We made great strides in understanding user needs, but unfortunately, we couldn’t conduct usability testing due to time constraints. Despite this, the experience taught me a lot about working in a real-world setting, and I’m grateful for the valuable lessons I gained along the way.
