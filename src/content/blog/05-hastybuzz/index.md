## My Role
I took on the responsibility of guiding the team through the process. I contributed by assisting in primary and secondary research, leading the interviews and analysis through product management frameworks, and designing and collaborating on Figma prototypes.

HastyBuzz, a visionary initiative, seeks to address these hurdles by offering small retailers the tools and support they need to thrive in a digital economy.
